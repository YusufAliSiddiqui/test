The diff tool shows exactly where the two files are different. 

The order in which you type the file names is also important. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could show you where you went wrong, it could show you what you did right previously. You don't have to worry about messing up, and you can experiment freely. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - You can decide when there is a logical change. 

Cons - Prone to human error. Puts on too much pressure to make a decision. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is primarily for programmers and to keep track of multiple files at once. Google docs is typically used to only keep track of single files at one time.
